# JavaScript Loose Typing and the + Operator

This example demonstrates how JavaScript's loose typing, specifically with the `+` operator, can lead to unexpected behavior. The `+` operator performs addition when used with numbers, but concatenation when used with strings.

The file `bug.js` shows the issue with different combinations of number and string inputs to the `foo` function. The file `bugSolution.js` provides a possible solution, but it's important to note that the best solution depends on the intended behavior of your function.
